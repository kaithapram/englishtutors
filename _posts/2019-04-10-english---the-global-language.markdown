English is the second most used language on the planet, only falling behind Mandarin. In fact, English is a language that has more individuals who use it as a second language than actual native speakers. That is a statistics that really shows why many people refer to English as the lingua franca. This definition is “a language that is adopted as a common language between speakers whose native languages are different.” English is used in everything these days but most importantly in business. 

Business professionals often refer to it as the international language of business. A majority of the best graduate-level business programs are taught in English, which means that if you understand this language then you will have an opportunity to get a sounder secondary education. Some top companies that are not even in English speaking countries require that employees have a degree that proves they are proficient in the language. 

Understanding English can truly open the door on all types of opportunities no matter what career field you plan to delve into one day. For example, within science and medicine, most of the technical terms used in these fields are rooted in English. If you do not know the language then you will not be able to effectively communicate with other professionals in the field. 

Needless to say, this can be incredibly problematic and your inability to speak English can prevent you from becoming a doctor one day. All of the scientific journals that post updates in research and medicine are also posted in English. The doctors who came across the new discovery can be from China or Germany, but their findings will still be posted in English. This means that you have no choice but to understand English, fluently. 

English is a language that is all over the place and can be a challenge to learn. However, what you need to work with an individual who knows exactly what they are doing. This is typically an English tutor who can sit down with you in a one-on-one setting and give you their undivided attention. The best way to learn any language is to actually practice with someone who can speak the language. 

There are several stories about individuals immersing themselves in a culture without knowing the language at all. After a few months to a year, they become entirely fluent because they were forced to learn the language. Of course, they do not learn the correct way of speaking and their grammar is flawed. But nonetheless, they know enough to communicate. 

Now imagine if you are able to sit down with someone who fully understands the language and can teach you the grammatically correct way of speaking along with the casual form. This is what will happen when you work with an expert tutor. 

Getting the right tutor is astonishingly powerful, especially for someone who wants to use English in their business ventures. We are all familiar with the ways in which you speak with your friends and potential business partners. They are not the same at all. If you use informal language in the wrong situation then you might not get that job that you have always wanted.

Although it might not seem fair, businesses judge you right off the bat. When you are in the interview it is basically a judgment stage. The employer is judging everything about you. Your look your resume and also your voice. This is because you are going to be representing the company and they want you to hold yourself in a certain way. If you do not meet the intangibles during the interview then you can kiss that job goodbye. This is why you must take the time out to learn from someone who understands the intricacies of both the informal and formal English language.

An English tutor like this will make sure your “going out with friends” use of the language is just as strong as your “on the job” use. However, you want to make sure you are working with a specialist who is going to keep you in line with all the rules of English. The last thing you want to do is spend your precious time with a tutor who is just as unsure about the guidelines of this language as you are, so you must find someone trustworthy. 

In conclusion, when you search for an English tutor near me make sure you do your research so that you can be matched with someone who is actually going to help you. Learning the language from a reputable tutor can mean landing that dream job and building a long-lasting career in your chosen field. The tutors are out there, it is just up to you to find them and start working toward achieving your goals.
